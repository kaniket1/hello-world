# hello-world
This is my repository that will start my exploration into the world of Github. 
We will do a lot of intersting things here. 
When I am done, I will be a champion of the world.

Hi Humans

Hubot here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of!).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to earth tacos.
